## Installation

To install the Python SDK, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed, then use pip:

```bash
pip install python-sdk
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started with the Python SDK:

```python
from python_sdk.main import cli

def main():
    cli()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script initializes the command-line interface provided by the SDK.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Programming Support**: Leverage Python's async capabilities for efficient I/O operations.
- **HTTP Client/Server Capabilities**: Build robust client-server applications with ease.
- **Command-line Interface**: Easily create and manage CLI applications.
- **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: Ensure code quality with built-in testing tools.
- **Data Validation and Serialization**: Utilize Pydantic for data validation and serialization.
- **Rich Examples and Tutorials**: Access a variety of examples to guide your development.

## Usage Examples

### Example: Simple Auth Client

```python
from examples.clients.simple_auth_client.mcp_simple_auth_client import main

def run_auth_client():
    main()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_auth_client()
```

### Example: FastMCP Complex Inputs

```python
from examples.fastmcp.complex_inputs import process_inputs

def handle_complex_inputs():
    process_inputs()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    handle_complex_inputs()
```

## API Overview

The Python SDK is structured into several key modules:

- **main**: Contains the primary entry points for CLI and configuration loading.
